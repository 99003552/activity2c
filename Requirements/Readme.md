# Requirements

To develop a scientific calculator which has not only the arithmetic functionality but also there are other functionalities such as special functions (i.e., square root, factorial, prime, etc.), trigonometric functions and conversion functions (i.e., meter to centimeter, etc.)

**STATE OF ART** :

- AGEING:
  - The first programmable calculator was given by HP that released in1968.
  - Later in 1972, the first pocket calculator came intopicture.
  - Nowadays, we can see that more than physical calculators people prefer the used of onlinecalculators.
- COSTING: Most of the physical calculators are costly however this project would reduce the cost to a huge extent as it is free to use.
