# Requirements of the project

  
# Requirements

To develop a scientific calculator which has not only the arithmetic functionality but also there are other functionalities such as special functions (i.e., square root, factorial, prime, etc.), trigonometric functions,conversion functions (i.e., meter to centimeter, etc.),Statistical functions(mean,median,variance,mode),Boolean functions(AND, OR, NOT, XOR, XNOR).

# SWOT Analysis

# Strengths:
- Can be used for both simple and complex calculations.
- Vast usage in market and integrating it with other various devices.

# Weaknesses:
- Numbers of inputs are limited.
- Cannot represent graphs.
- can't store data.

# Opportunities:
- Must have device for students for its high functionality and low cost.

# threats:
- Cannot be comopared with the latest calculators that have spreadsheets, graphs etc.


# 4W1H

- What: Our product is a portable calculating device used for computations like addition,subtraction etc.along with complex computations like logarithm, exponential, trigonometric etc.,

- Why: To reduce time consumption and simplify calculations.

- When: It is used when we required computations with functions which cannot be easily defined.

- Where: Complex, complicated computation is needed in in fields of aerospace, mathematics, engineeringetc.,

- How: Scientific calculator can be used with the numbers along with defined functions required for the computation.
